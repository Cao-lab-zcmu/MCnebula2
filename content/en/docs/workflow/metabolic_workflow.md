To illustrate the application of MCnebula in metabolism, we re-analyzed the
serum data from Wozniak et al. (DOI:
<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.07.040>).  The serum samples were
collected from patients in-hospital infected with Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremia (SaB) or not and healthy volunteers. Overall, the samples were
divided into 1) control groups, involving NN (non-hospital, non-infected) and
HN (hospital, non-infected); 2) infection groups, involving HS (hospital,
survival), HM (hospital, mortality) ...

The codes and description for the analysis:
